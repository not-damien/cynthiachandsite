                Project Goal: Our screen recording chrome extension will allow people an easy way to record their screen, individual browsers, and specific tabs with or without audio. Buttons are large and distinct from each other making it easy to understand what they each do, and overall should have solid accessibility.
                </p>
                Target Audience: People who want a simpler and easier way to easily screen record without installing an app.
                <p>
                Challenges: Creating large, easy to understand buttons
                </p>
                Research Summary: We wanted to see what happens when kids and parents follow the flow of this app.
                <p>
                Upon completion of the research we concluded that bolding the lettering was an improvement that needed to be made, and possibly clarifying the webcam option.
