                Challenges: Incorporating accessibility features
                </p>
                Research Summary: We wanted to see what types of issues occur when a user utilizes our app in order to better design it and some up with solutions to any potential bugs or dead ends that may occur.
                <p>
                Upon completion of the research we concluded that accessibility is something that needs to be taken into account, and also that user flow for this sort of app is typically convoluted and could be improved upon.
