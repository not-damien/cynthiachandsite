                <p>My role: UX Designer and Researcher</p>
                <p>
                Project Goal: The goal was to create a desktop widget that would allow for users to easily share files between computers without the restriction of methods such as sending emails. 
                </p>
                Target Audience: People who work in collaboration with others and need a way to securely share files.
                <p>
                Challenges: Keeping the design simple and easy to understand while also having enough options for more experienced users.
                </p>
                Research Summary: Users find that their options are limited which in turn actually makes the widget more confusing to use. The design has been reevaulated to account for this addition.
